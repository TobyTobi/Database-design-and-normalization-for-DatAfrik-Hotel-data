# Data Normalization and Database Design Mini-Project

## Overview
The primary goal of this mini-project was to enhance the efficiency and consistency of information storage and retrieval within a hotel dataset. The task was executed in two key phases, each contributing to the overall optimization of data representation.

## Process
1. Identification and Organization of Data Attributes: In this phase, diverse data attributes such as hotel details, customer information, booking specifics, and payment details were identified and organized.
The restructuring process adhered to the principles of database normalization, encompassing 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF for optimal data organization and storage.
2. Database Design: During the database design phase, the emphasis was on establishing robust relationships between distinct tables, ensuring logical connections for efficient querying.
This involved defining primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between entities within the dataset.

## Implementation
Throughout the entire process, SQL queries and tools were leveraged to implement the designed schema.
The outcome is a fully functional database, ready for practical application, and data import.
